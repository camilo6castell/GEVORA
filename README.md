## About

Gevora is a web application developed using **Python** and the **Flask** library. It covers both frontend and backend, utilizing **MySQL** as the relational database, and is deployed on **PythonAnywhere**.

This project was developed as an exercise in the _"MisiónTIC"_ program, an initiative by the Colombian government to train programmers in response to the high demand for these professionals.

## Features

Gevora addresses various needs of a hotel company with the following functionalities:

1. Session management
2. Views based on session state
3. User registration
4. User management (edit or delete existing users)
5. Room management (add or delete existing rooms)
6. Download updated information about the application
7. Secure credential encryption in the database and verification within the application system
8. Proper handling of potential errors within the application
